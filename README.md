## COMP10002 Assignment 2 Feedback: khandelwalt

### Program Presentation Including: layout and style, readability, adherence to coding expectations, general care and appearance.
One of the following lines will be retained by the marker.  
•	Up to Stage 1 initial allocation, +1.  
•	Up to Stage 2 initial allocation, +2.  
•	Up to Stage 3 initial allocation, +3.  

Deductions.  
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker. Marks in each section won&apos;t go below zero.  
•	absence of function prototypes, -0.5; // function prototypes should be placed above the main function and function definitions after the main. 

Additions (included in total mark only if marks lost within this first section)  
•	comment that says "algorithms are awesome", +0.5;  

Other Comments from Marker  

### Structure and Approach  
Including: decomposition in to functions, development of data structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations, choice of parameters to functions, use of appropriate struct and typedef declarations, choice of algorithms or methods.  

One of the following lines will be retained by the marker.  
•	Up to Stage 1 initial allocation, +1.  
•	Up to Stage 2 initial allocation, +2.  
•	Up to Stage 3 initial allocation, +5.  

Deductions  
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker. Marks in each section won&apos;t go below zero.  
•	other structural issue (minor), -0.5; // not freeing the memory allocated to linked list.

### Program Execution  
Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation and readability.
Programs that do not compile in the test environment will lose all marks in this section. Be sure to verify your submission and check the output before you say "finished" to yourself.

One of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
•	Up to Stage 1 initial allocation, +1.
•	Up to Stage 2 initial allocation, +3.
•	Up to Stage 3 initial allocation, +5.

Deductions
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker. Marks in each section won&apos;t go below zero.
•	deduct all execution marks if program generates no output at all; otherwise, deduct marks for the following items:
•	incorrect Stage 3 output on invis0, -0.5;
•	incorrect Stage 3 output on invis1, -0.5;

Late Penalty If you make a late submission without having prior agreement from the lecturer, late submission penalties will apply. Overall marks won&apos;t go below zero.

11.5 Overall comments from marker:

Good work. Your code almost works as expected, and is structured and presented relatively well. I wish you had also done stage 4. Best of luck with the exam.
